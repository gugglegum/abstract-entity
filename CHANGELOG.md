# Change Log

## 1.1.0 (2017-10-30)

 * Added possibility to set user-defined exception class for all exceptions generated by AbstractEntity. This may be
   very useful when you make some component and you don't want to give away details of the internal implementation. 
   Your component usually have its own exception class and this is all what user using your component need to know.
   User shouldn't keep in mind about AbstractEntity you used to catch all exceptions from your component. 
 * Added PHPUnit tests coverage.
 * The `getAttributeNames()` method now returns only non-static properties, i.e. if you model class or it's parent
   class has static property -- it will not be included in list.
 * Eliminated static variables from `getAttributeNames()` and `hasAttribute()`. Static variables may result 
   unexpected behavior if static variable in parent class initialized before child class loaded. Now we use
   class static properties with 2-dimension array where first level is name of concrete model class.
 * The `hasAttribute()` now is a static method. Being static you still able to call it via non-static calls.

## 1.0.1 (2017-05-15)

 * The `getAttributeNames()` method now returns also properties of all parent classes.

## 1.0.0 (2017-04-11)

 * First release. Usage of `\ReflectionClass` to retrieve model class properties to return them as list of attributes in
   `getAttributeNames()` method.
